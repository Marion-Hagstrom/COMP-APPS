Background and Motivation: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for men and women in the United States. Lung cancer can show up on a chest X-ray as a small mass. Many patients do not know they may have cancer until they are X-rayed. However, lung cancer is easy to misidentify and can be overlooked if the patient does not know they have lung cancer. Hence, we created this code to help screen X-ray images for masses in the lungs. This program uses deep learning and has an expected accuracy rate of 91%. The reported label from a program is meant to be supplemental, to help doctors screen for lung masses. If the doctor and the program disagree, more attention may be brought to a scan. However, this program is NOT meant to replace a doctor’s diagnosis. 
How to use: [KAREN INSTERT]
After saving your rbg image, navigate to “BME3053C_Final (1).mlx” and follow the prompts at the end of the code for inserting your image. Remove the comments (%) before running. 
Credits: This code utilizes the neural network AlexNet. We trained the network on images from the NIH Chest X-ray dataset. Then code was ran on MATLAB 2022a. The members of this project that contributed are Marion Hagstrom, Karen Villancio-Wolter, Sarah Scott, and Brendan McCue.
